# E-commerce

My First Full Stack App using Mern. I managed to make it work and deployed on a free hosting service. Codes is messy and no css framework has been used, only plain CSS. When I building this project I have no idea that I can finish it because I am not familiar about hosting. At the time I finished this project and I deployed it online with back-end services. I was motivated to build a full stack again. And the result was the Movie app and the todo app postgresql
